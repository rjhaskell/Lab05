# Lab05
1. Created repository "lab05" on github.
2. Cloned remote repository to local folder.
- Initial project setup went well in setting up required files.
3. Followed cc.com setup for es6-promise to work proper.
4. Tried fiddling with single line solution to no avail.
5. Copied "trivial" example of Promise usage and tried to understand.
6. Adapted example pattern to incorporate getProducts() function by assigning proxy variable p.
-This allows the use of .then and .catch methods inherited from Promise (obj?) to be called given the "result" parameter... I think.
7. Warm fuzzy feeling with array of 4 strings in console.
8. Implemented MD formating to README.md
