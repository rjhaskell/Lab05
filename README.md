# Lab05
-Created repository "lab05" on github.
-Cloned remote repository to local folder.
-Initial project setup went well in setting up required files.
-Followed cc.com setup for es6-promise to work proper.
-Tried fiddling with single line solution to no avail.
-Copied "trivial" example of Promise usage and tried to understand.
-Adapted example pattern to incorporate getProducts() function by  
assigning proxy variable p.
-This allows the use of .then and .catch methods inherited from Promise (obj?)  
to be called given the "result" parameter... I think.
-Warm fuzzy feeling with array of 4 strings in console.
-Implemented MD formating to README.md
